				<p data-name="After my first visit to Griffith Observatory, it quickly became one of my favorite places to visit. From browsing the many exhibits inside the observatory to admiring the city skyline, the things to do there seem endless. I found the view from the top of the mountains to be very calming and extremely beautiful, especially at dusk and night." data-pic="images/p_4.jpg"> Griffith Observatory </p>
				<p data-name="I toured The Getty, one of the world's largest arts organizations, as part of a residential program. The stone architecture was beautiful, housing a lovely garden to relax in, and its location on a mountain provided a breathtaking view of the city of Los Angeles. I enjoyed all the exhibits, particularly the ones featuring decorative arts from all different countries and time periods." data-pic="images/p_5.jpg"> The Getty </p>
				<p data-name="Santa Monica Beach had a beautiful view of the North Pacific Ocean, and I enjoyed walking along the sand and watching the gentle waves. 3rd Street Promenade also was a great place to tour, with many shops and restaurants to explore." data-pic="images/p_6.jpg"> Santa Monica Pier </p>

				<p> I visited Seattle during Spring Break of 2019 with some of my close friends. It was a beautiful city and we all enjoyed the exciting things it had to offer. The most memorable places to me were the waterfront where we went on the Great Wheel, the Museum of Pop Culture, and the Space Needle. </p>

				<p data-name="The Museum of Pop Culture is definitely for fans of pop culture. I particularly enjoyed the Indie Game Revolution exhibit, where the interior had lots of pixel cube structures and you could play from a collection of indie games. The exhibit Fantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic was also interesting; I got to read more on Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and more." data-pic="images/p_7.jpg"> MoPOP </p>
				<p data-name="The Seattle Waterfront is one of my favorite places in Seattle. It was a sunny day when we went, and the view of the city from on top the Great Wheel was beautiful. The waterfront had a calming atmosphere, and we just stood there and watched the light hit the waves." data-pic="images/p_9.jpg"> Seattle Waterfront </p>
				<p data-name="Seattle's most well-known destination is arguably the Space Needle. We went to the top of the Space Needle at night and had a great view of city skyline at night. There was an area with glass floors where we got to experience the thrill of seeing the city from under us." data-pic="images/p_8.jpg"> Space Needle </p>
				<p data-name="The medieval architecture at the University of Washington was most memorable to me, with the Suzzallo and Allen Libraries being our favorite place there. They also had a huge and green campus, although we did not arrive in time for the cherry blossoms." data-pic="images/p_10.jpg"> U of Washington </p>

			<div class="personal-desc">
				<p> Bullet journaling, for me, is a way of relaxing my mind. I started keeping a bullet journal in 2017 and found that it helped me in becoming more organized, remembering events, and getting ready for the week ahead. I particuarly enjoy creating each week's layout and brush calligraphy writing. Even if I wind up not adding to it daily, it still helps me be more efficient in my day to day tasks. </p>
