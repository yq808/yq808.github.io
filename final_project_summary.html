	<h2> Final Project Summary </h2>

	<p>
		My final project is a personal portfolio that includes an overview of myself, my creative work, and personal aspects such as places I visited or my hobbies. Through combining the two areas together, I hope to both market myself to potential employers and allow peers to understand me better.

	<p>
		I chose to incorporate the components of keyframe animations, Bootstrap carousel, and flexbox on my site. On each page, I added an animation where the site fades from white to reveal the content as it loads. I also included animation in my About page, where the tilting boxes are made using keyframes. The image slider at the top of the homepage is a Bootstrap component. Flexbox was used multiple times throughout the site, such as to center content vertically or to create many columns in a row like in the Works pages.

	<p>
		I used Javascript for the navigation that appears on screen sizes tablet and smaller. Clicking on the logo icon at the top left corner will open up the navigation menu, where there is a “close” button that minimizes the menu on click. Moreover, on the About page when a user clicks on one of the boxes, text appears underneath and the box stops tilting. On the very first click of the boxes the “Learn About Me” text will also disappears. The Personal page utilizes some more Javascript. The first click on a boxed item will expand it to display its contents, and subsequently clicking on each box will replace the images and text.
