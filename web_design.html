		<h2> Web Design </h2>
		<p> The intersection of design and web languages perfectly melds my two interests and allows me to not only conceptualize beautiful looking websites, but also turn them into a reality. </p>
	</div>

    <div class="web-design">
        <h2> Languages </h2>
        <p> I'm proficient in <em>HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP</em>, with experience in using Node and React JS. Therefore, you will see that the majority of the websites I create use some combination of these languages. My forte is front-end web development, though I've also been involved in projects on the back-end side of things. </p>

        <h3> Bookmark </h3>

        <p> Bookmark is a conceptual online library and book discovery website. The aim was for users to expand their breadth and depth of books they have read. The directory of books was from a web API and I experimented with different ways of display the books on the website for the best consumer experience. </p>
        <p> On the home page, users can look through new releases in the categories of fantasy, graphic novel, and biography/autobiography. The books displayed are subject to change as they are ordered by newest releases first. There are also brief descriptions of and links to the other pages on the site. </p>
        <p> The biggest challenge was the book list, which is personable to every user and saves the history of books they have added to the list. When users click on the "save book" button, the book is saved into local storage and accessed via local storage to load them onto the list page. </p>

        <p> LA Explorer is a website geared towards locations to visit in the city of Los Angeles. Through the website, users are able to find new places to explore in Los Angeles. </p>
        <p> Created as a final project of a back-end web development class, languages such as PHP were used to create a dynamic, data-driven application. A database was implemented to hold data. </p>

For example, the Favorites and Add Form pages are only accessible after users create an account and sign in. Similarly, users are only able to edit and delete attractions that they have added to the database. </p>
        <p> Due to the use of a database, user activity is saved and users can return to them at any time! Attractions that users have favorited will show up on the Favorites page. </p>

        <h3> BooksnBucks </h3>

        <p> BooksnBucks is an application created by an non profit team that aims to help students and schools across the Los Angeles area to excel in learning and encourage deeper interaction with the class material. Our team of five was focused on designing a student dashboard so students are able to access their rewards, view a history of their progress in class, and purchase novelty items with reward points. </p>
        <p> On the front-end, frameworks such as React JS and Bootstrap were used, and in them we trialed with elements such as pagination, tooltip manipulation, and Node-SASS. On the back-end, we used Node JS and implemented Firebase's realtime database. We also used HotJar to test the final website design on users to see the bounce rate and smoothness of browsing. </p>

        <!-- <p> We started off with a proposition: students cannot find a way to continue staying motivated and engaged in virtual learning the way they did with in-person because of a lack of engagement and support. Therefore, the app provides a way for students to track their progress in their classes, and the positive feedback loop of point redemption motivate thems to perform better in class to gain rewards. </p> -->
        <p> The application called for a design that is both fun and intuitive enough for very young students, but also older students to enjoy and understand. Rather than crowding the dashboard with unnecessary details, we focused on key elements in order to present the material; bigger frames, bigger buttons, bigger text, and most importantly, color! </p>
        <p> The entire BooksnBucks project taught me the crucial steps of testing and development of a major product. I learned how to conduct effective user research, create wireframes, how to use git workflow, and communication strategies with the rest of the team. </p>
        <p> We were not without our challenges. Working in a team required a lot of communication and we were able to improve at git workflow and collaboration to make the merging process easier for ourselves. We also initially struggled with testing back-end functions, database inconsistencies, and implementation on the front-end, but were able to overcome the challenges in the end. </p>

        <h3> Animal Crossing Builds </h3>

        <p> As an avid player of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game, I wanted a place full of build inspiration that I could browse for ideas to incorporate into my own game, but also a place where I could share interesting builds that I stumbled across. Enter Crossing Builds! </p>
        <p> The entire application was built in Laravel and is connected to a Postgres database. Users can filter their search and browse builds, as well as add their own. There's also a profile page showing a users' favorite builds and their own build submissions. Features of the site include server-side validation, comments sections for builds, login authentication, and authorization. </p>

        <p> It was a fun and informative experience to work in Laravel and gain knowledge in frameworks that are used by the industry. Although the setup was tedious and involved multiple files to be open at the same time just for one page, in the long run it made everything much easier to manage, and more efficient to edit in the future. </p>
